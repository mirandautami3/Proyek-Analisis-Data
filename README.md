# Wanliu Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
This project is a Streamlit dashboard for analyzing air quality data in Wanliu. The dashboard provides insights into PM2.5 and PM10 pollution levels, as well as their correlation with various environmental factors, such as temperature and wind speed.

# Features
Data Upload: Upload a CSV file with air quality data.
Statistical Summary: View key statistics of the dataset, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
PM2.5 and PM10 Distribution: Visualize the distribution of PM2.5 and PM10 particles in the air using histograms.
Correlation Matrix: Analyze the correlation between environmental factors and pollution levels.
Insights: Understand how environmental factors, such as temperature and wind speed, affect air quality.

# Installation
# Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/mirandautami3/Proyek-Analisis-Data.git

# Navigate to the project folder:
cd Proyek-Analisis-Data

# Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run dashboardmiranda.py

# Requirements
streamlit==1.30.0
pandas==2.1.4
matplotlib==3.8.2
seaborn==0.13.0
numpy==1.26.2
statsmodels==0.14.0
scipy==1.11.4

# Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Upload a CSV file containing air quality data (e.g., PRSA_Data_Wanliu_20130301-20170228.csv).
View the summary statistics, visualizations, and insights generated by the dashboard.

# Data
The dashboard analyzes air quality data, focusing on the following pollutants:

PM2.5: Fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers.
PM10: Particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers.
The dataset used in this project is PRSA_Data_Wanliu, which records air quality measurements in Wanliu over a period of time.

# Insights
Question 1: How do changes in temperature and wind speed affect PM2.5 levels in Wanliu?
Warmer temperatures and higher wind speeds tend to correlate with increased PM2.5 levels due to various factors, including human activity and pollutant dispersion.

Question 2: Does air quality (PM2.5 and PM10) worsen during certain months of the year?
Pollution levels tend to rise in the winter months, likely due to increased fuel usage for heating and stagnant atmospheric conditions.
